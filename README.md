## Paging3 Pagination from Remote API & Local Cache

- Paging 3 library in Android is used for handling large data sets in a more efficient way,
particularly when working with RecyclerViews.

- Paging 3 is part of the Android Jetpack library and provides a set of components to load and display
large data sets incrementally.

You should consider using Paging 3 in Android under the following scenarios:

    Large Datasets: When dealing with a large amount of data that cannot be loaded entirely into memory at once.

    Efficient Loading: When you want to load and display data incrementally, providing a smoother user experience.

    Network Requests: When loading data from a network source, Paging 3 helps in making efficient network requests and managing the data.

    Database Paging: When working with local databases (e.g., Room database), Paging 3 can efficiently load data from the database.

    RecyclerView Integration: When you want to seamlessly integrate with RecyclerView to efficiently display paginated data.

Here's a basic example of when you might use Paging 3:

```kotlin
// Create a PagingConfig
val pagingConfig = PagingConfig(pageSize = 20, enablePlaceholders = false)

// Create a Pager
val pager: Pager<Int, YourDataType> = Pager(
    config = pagingConfig,
    pagingSourceFactory = { YourPagingSource() }
)

// Create a LiveData to observe
val pagedLiveData: LiveData<PagingData<YourDataType>> = pager.liveData

```
In this example, YourPagingSource would be a class that extends PagingSource, responsible for loading data in chunks.
